Hey Chad, \nAre you in the office this afternoon? I need to talk to you, preferably as soon as possible. There are some issues with our last print ad and I’m worried about how to move forward. \nI’ll stop by your office after lunch to check in, but let me know your availability if you get this before. \n\nBest, \nJenny

Confirm your card\n\nHello Chad,\nYou linked your debit or credit card to your PayPal account on . To make sure the card is yours, we made a small charge to it that you'll need to confirm (and we'll refund the money to your PayPal account when you're done).\nThe charge creates a unique 4-digit code on your card statement. If you don't see the charge right away, don't worry - sometimes it takes a few days to show up. If you can't check your card statement online, check your paper statement when it comes in the mail (this can take up to 30 days). You will find the charge from PayPal with a 4-digit code.\nWhen that's done, you'll be able to pay safer online with your card through PayPal - without ever exposing your financial information to sellers.\n\nSincerely,\nPayPal 
Kindly find the attached and Confirm accept. \nRegards, \n\nSent from my Iphone\n\nView Slideshow \nDownload all as zip (1).

I will be highly appreciative if you can handle it before the close of banking transactions for today.I can’t take calls now so an email will be fine. \n\nRobert. 
Hi Chad, \nI need to pick up my daughter from daycare on Friday. My husband is out on a business trip and he usually handles Fridays.

They are attached, and here’s a google doc link as well. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1e9FI2ghj2PMWF8c9Jtk1iOJ1HREpiVGCWwVlKDpE/edit\n\nBest, \nStephanie Lee \nHuman Resources\nEight Bit Inc.

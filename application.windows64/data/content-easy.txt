My beloved fellowship \n\n I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please this letter is a request from in dire need of assistance. I am Mrs. Gerlinde SIFFORD, from South Africa and require assistance to donate the sum of ($2,950,000) inherited from my late husband into your personal/company account. \n \n Before his death, he was a former South Africa envoy who worked with our Embassy in Accra Ghana for nine years before he died on 26th December 2015 I am holding $2,950,000 which he deposited in a private security company in Accra, Ghana. Recently, my doctor told me that I would not last for the next four months due to cancer and leave this fund to orphange since we didn’t have any child. \n \n Having known my condition I decided to donate it into your care to utilize to help the orphans, old age home and other people that need financial assistance. Contact me for more information via my e-mail: slifford62@saintly.com  So that I will forward you all the procedure about this fund. \n \n With love, hoping to receive your response immediately, \n \n Mrs. Gerlinde SIFFORD written from hospital bed
